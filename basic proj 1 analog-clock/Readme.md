# Analog Clock Project

This is a simple analog clock project that I created as part of my learning phase. The clock displays the current time and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Demo

To view the project, simply open the ``analog.html`` file in your preferred web browser. The clock will start automatically and display the current time.
## Project Details

The analog clock is built using HTML5 canvas, and the styling is done with CSS. The JavaScript code is responsible for calculating the current time and updating the clock accordingly.

This project was created as my very first beginner project during my learning phase, and serves as a testament to my growth as a developer.
