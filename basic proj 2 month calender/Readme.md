# Calender Project

This is a simple calender project that I created as part of my learning phase. The calender displays the current day,month,year and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Demo

To view the project, simply open the ``calen.html`` file in your preferred web browser. The project will start automatically and display the calender.
## Project Details

The calender is built using HTML5 canvas, and the styling is done with CSS. The JavaScript code is responsible for calculating the current date.

This project was created as my very first beginner project during my learning phase, and serves as a testament to my growth as a developer.
