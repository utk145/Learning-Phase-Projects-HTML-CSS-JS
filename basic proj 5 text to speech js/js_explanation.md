- This is JavaScript code that sets up a speech synthesis interface, allowing a user to enter text and have it spoken aloud by the browser. Here's what each part of the code does:

    - The first line creates a new `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` object, which represents a speech request.
    - The `speech.lang` property sets the language of the speech to English.
    - The `voices` array is initially empty, but will be populated with available voices once the `onvoiceschanged` event is fired.
    - When the `onvoiceschanged` event is fired (which happens when the system finishes loading available voices), the voices array is populated with available voices, and the first voice is selected as the default. The `selectVoice` variable is a reference to an HTML select element that allows the user to choose a different voice, and its options are set to the available voices.
    - The next three event listeners update the `rate`, `volume`, and `pitch` properties of the speech object when the corresponding input elements are changed. These properties control the speed, volume, and pitch of the speech, respectively. Each listener also updates a corresponding label element to display the current value.
    - The `voices` event listener updates the `speech.voice` property of the speech object when the user chooses a different voice from the select element.
    - The `start` event listener sets the `speech.text` property of the `speech` object to the text in the `textarea` element, and calls window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech) to start speaking the text.
    - The `pause`, `resume`, and `cancel` event listeners call `window.speechSynthesis.pause()`, `window.speechSynthesis.resume()`, and `window.speechSynthesis.cancel()`, respectively, to pause, resume, or stop speaking the current text.
