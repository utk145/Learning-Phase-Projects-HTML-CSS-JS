# Find the Hidden Image Game

This is a simple JavaScript game where the goal is to find a hidden image on the screen. The game generates a random location for the image on the screen, and the player must click on the image to "find" it. Once the image is found, the game displays a congratulatory message with the time it took to find the image, and generates a new location for the image.

## Getting Started
To play the game, simply open the `game.html` file in your web browser. The game will automatically start when the page loads.
## How to Play
To play the game, move your mouse cursor around the screen to find the hidden image. The image will be a small icon of a face. When you find the image, click on it to "find" it. The game will display a message telling you how long it took to find the image, and generate a new location for the image. The game will continue until you close the web page.
## Technical Details
The game is implemented using JavaScript, and uses the `Math.random()` function to generate a random location for the image on the screen. The game also uses the `Date()` function to measure the time it takes to find the image. The game is designed to be simple and easy to understand, and can be customized or modified as needed.
