# Simple Frontend Tesla Landing Page Clone

This is a simple frontend responsive project that aims to clone the Tesla landing page using HTML and CSS. The goal is to recreate the look and feel of the original website.
## Project Status
Currently, I am working on implementing the scroll effect seen on the original Tesla website. This scroll effect will provide a smooth scrolling experience and enhance the user interface.
## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

To view the Tesla landing page clone, simply open the `tesla.html` file in a web browser.
Please note that due to copyright issues that may arise, I have not included the assets folder in this repository. However, you can directly obtain the images from the official Tesla website at [Tesla website](https://www.tesla.com).
